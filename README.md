# python_crash_course_notes_exercises

- A repository containing all of my notes, example and exercise attempts from the resource 'Python Crash Course.'
- The content I cover ranges from the very basics of variables all the way to object oriented programming using classes.
- As you will no doubt see, my coding proficiency gets considerably better by the end, but is still short of what it is in later projects.
- I primarily use this repository as a reminder to myself that if the going gets tough, look how far you've come in such a short space of time!
